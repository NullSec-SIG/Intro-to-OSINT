KSI's new hit, Thick of It,
Is more than a song — it’s where secrets sit.
A flag split in four, scattered far and wide,
Across the digital world, where clues collide.

Each clue is locked, waiting to be found,
In files and posts, where traces abound.
The hunt is on, the pieces await,
Hidden in places you must navigate.

So listen close, and dig real deep,
The flag's out there — no time to sleep.
Can you uncover the truth, bit by bit?
And claim the prize from the Thick of It?

The flag you seek, a treasure so rare,
Is hidden in riddles, scattered with care.
Its format is simple, just as it's shown:
NULL{} — the flag stands fully alone.

Search through the clues, let nothing evade,
The truth will emerge from the trail that’s laid.
Find it, reveal it, the hunt is your call,
No need to wrap it — the flag says it all!
