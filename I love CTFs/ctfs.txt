Mission Brief:

You’ve just received a cryptic message from an individual who claims to be one of the top CTF (Capture The Flag) teams in the country, renowned for their skill and notorious for winning multiple high-profile CTF competitions. This is not someone you want to underestimate. In a brazen move, they’ve left a trail — a seemingly innocuous clue hidden in plain sight. The hacker, confident in their ability to stay anonymous, has purchased a domain name that is suspiciously tied to one of their aliases. But there’s more. The domain isn’t some obscure, hard-to-remember string — it’s linked to the first six characters of that alias. And, of course, because they know all too well how the internet works, they've opted for the most common TLD, one that nearly everyone is familiar with.
